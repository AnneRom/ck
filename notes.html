    <h3>Digital computer</h3>
    <hr>
    1. The digital computer is called so as it is designed to process information in numerical(digitized) form.
   2. In computer circuits, binary digits are easily represented) by the presence or absence of a current or voltage.
    3. A digital word may specify not only the magnitude of the number in question, but also its sign, and may also contain (redundant bits that allow automatic determination, and in some cases, corrections, of certain errors.
     4. The operational speed of the CPU is largely determines the computer's overall performance.
      5. The control unit corresponds to the human brain and the memory to a notebook that stores the program, initial data, results of intermediate and final calculations.
       6. In the case of an electronic computer, the CPU and fast memories are implementes on transistor circuits.
        7. Computer peripherals consist of inut units for entering data and commands into the computer and output units for displaying results.
         8. Late optical and magneto-optical storage are also quite common, such as CD-ROMS and DVD-ROMS.
          9. Digital computers are capable of performing thousands of trillions of arithmetic and logic operations per second, thus permitting quick resolution of tasks that a person would not be able to solve manually.
           10. In addition to arithmetic and logic circuits, the CPU has schematics that decodes the set of instructions, or program, and causes it to be executed.
